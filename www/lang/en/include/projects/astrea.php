			<p>Built to make its users professional lives easier, this web application is intended to autonomous lawyers and small and medium sized offices. With Astrea the lawyer follows lawsuits, manages events and tasks, generates invoices, keeps document files and much more. All of these in a safe and collaborative environment.</p>
			<p>The project is constantly evolving. That's why in a partnership with the Astrea company we continue to work in the app's development and improvement. We colaborate in the stages of research and user testing, mockups' development and validation, interface design, client-side code's implementation and maintenance.</p>
