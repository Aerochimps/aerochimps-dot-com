			<p>We brought forward this application in a partnership with the technology company Way2. It was developed to hydroelectric power plants and is intended for engineers and technicians to track information and to the institutional presentation. Through the display, the user has access to real numbers of the plant's power generation. These numbers were arranged to facilitate the data's reading and understanding by the user.</p>
			<p>We worked in the solution's ideation and interface development, designed for screens of at least 32-inch.</p>
