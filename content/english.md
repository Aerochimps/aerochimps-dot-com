##Projects
We highlighted our main projects for you to know us better.

###aws journey
web campaign app

We developed this viral campaign in a partnership with Clint Studio for Amazon Web Service (AWS). The project celebrates, in a fun and cheerful way the milestone of two trillion objects stored in the cloud by AWS.

The user learns the importance of this number on a journey through space. The stored objects turn into fuel to the AWS rocket, which flies further thanks to its client's gigantic potential. At the end of the journey it is possible to share the results on Facebook and earn credits to use for Amazon Web Service.
The whole concept, content, interaction and integration was produced closely with the client. To the website development, we used only HTML, CSS and JS languages.
