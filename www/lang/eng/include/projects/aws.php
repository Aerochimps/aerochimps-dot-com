			<h1>AWS Journey</h1>
			<strong>Web campaign app</strong>
		</header>
		<div class="description">
			<p>We developed this viral campaign in a partnership with Clint Studio for Amazon Web Service (AWS). The project celebrates, in a fun and cheerful way, the mark of two trillion objects stored in the cloud by AWS.</p>
			<p>The user understands the importance of this number on a journey through space. The stored objects turn into fuel to the AWS rocket, which flies increasingly far thanks to its client's gigantic potential. At the end of the journey, it is possible to share the page on Facebook and earn credits to use on Amazon Web Service.</p>
			<p>The whole concept, content, interaction and integration was produced closely with the client. To the website development, we used only HTML, CSS and JS languages.</p>
